        <p> I decided to go with the platformer idea and create a 2D platformer game where players play as a King travelling through his castle and trying to avoid monsters along the way. I followed a tutorial that is linked above to create the outline of the game and added my own code to create animations of monsters and level resets. I had issues with playing audio on the web (chrome) becasue it got blocked by chrome policies. There are also a few bugs that happen when you spam buttons or hold them down for too long, which can cause the player to fall off the map.</p>
